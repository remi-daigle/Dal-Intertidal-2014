Dal-Intertidal-2014
===================

A repository for all field data and R code for the scientific paper and consultant report

These instructions assume you have already installed R (http://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/). Also, if you are not already using the GitHub native app, you should really consider using Git or GitHub in the future! Version control will improve your life.

Instructions:
=============
1. If you have the GitHub native app installed (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-windows) you can click "Clone in Desktop", otherwise click "Download ZIP" and extract the folder

2. Open Rstudio, in the files tab (bottom right) find the folder you just downloaded that includes the project Dal-Intertidal-2014.Rproj

3. You can make changes to the files locally (on your computer) as you normally would, the GitHub app will keep track of the changes you've made.

4. Once you're ready to share your changes with your classmates, "commit" and "sync" your changes with the Github app (try to give a useful description of the changes you've made) and others will then be able to sync your changes to their local files
